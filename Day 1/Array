#Array

Array is a contiguously-allocated data structure. Arrays are structures of fixed-size data records such
that each element can be efficiently located by its index.

## Some of the advantages of array data structure include:

 - Constant-time access given the index – Because the index of each element maps directly to a
    particular memory address, we can access arbitrary data items instantly, provided we know the
    index.
 - Space efficiency – Arrays consist purely of data, so no space is wasted with links or other
    formatting information. Further, end-of-record information is not needed because arrays are built
    from fixed-size records.
  -Memory locality – We often want to iterate through all the elements of a data structure. Arrays
    are good for this because they exhibit excellent memory locality. Physical continuity between
    successive data accesses helps exploit the high-speed cache memory on modern computer
    architectures.
    Modern processors, when caches a memory cell from computer hard disk to RAM, it often caches
    some neighbor cells with it. So next time if the processor needs to access immediate next memory
    cell, it can access it from RAM, resulting in faster access of data.
